This React-based 3D portfolio project allows you to showcase your 3D objects and includes a contact form powered by Email.js. Below, you'll find an in-depth guide on setting up, running, and customizing this project.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: If not installed, download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: If not installed, get it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3dportfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 3dportfolio
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

To enable the contact form functionality, you need to configure your Email.js credentials. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following information:

```dotenv
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USERID=your_emailjs_user_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATEID=your_emailjs_template_id
```

Replace `your_emailjs_user_id` and `your_emailjs_template_id` with your Email.js user ID and template ID.

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The project will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you can view it in your web browser.

## Project Dependencies

This project relies on several external libraries and dependencies, each serving a specific purpose:

- **@emailjs/browser** - ^3.11.0: Used for sending emails through the contact form.
- **@react-three/drei** - ^9.88.3: Provides a collection of useful components for React Three Fiber.
- **@react-three/fiber** - ^8.14.6: A React renderer for Three.js, enabling the creation of 3D scenes.
- **framer-motion** - ^10.16.4: Adds smooth animations and transitions to your UI components.
- **maath** - ^0.10.4: (Please provide more information about this package's role in your project).
- **react** - ^18.2.0: The core library for building the user interface.
- **react-dom** - ^18.2.0: Allows rendering React components to the DOM.
- **react-router-dom** - ^6.17.0: Facilitates client-side routing in your React application.
- **react-tilt** - ^1.0.2: (Please provide more information about this package's role in your project).
- **react-vertical-timeline-component** - ^3.6.0: (Please provide more information about this package's role in your project).
- **three** - ^0.157.0: The primary library for 3D graphics, used in combination with React Three Fiber.

Please ensure that you keep these dependencies up to date to maintain the project's performance and security.

## Project Structure

The project follows standard React conventions, with its source code residing in the `src` directory. Here's a brief overview of key files and directories:

- **src/components**: Contains React components for building the user interface. You can customize these components to add your personal touch to the portfolio.

- **src/styles**: Houses the project's CSS or styles. Feel free to modify the styles to match your branding and aesthetic preferences.

- **src/assets**: This is where you can place your 3D object files. Make sure they are in a format compatible with Three.js.

## Adding 3D Objects

1. Prepare your 3D object files in a format compatible with Three.js (e.g., `.gltf`, `.obj`, or `.fbx`).

2. Place your 3D object files in the `src/assets` directory of the project.

3. Open the appropriate component where you want to display the 3D object (e.g., `src/components/Portfolio.js`), and import your 3D model.

4. Use the imported 3D model within your component to display it within the portfolio.
